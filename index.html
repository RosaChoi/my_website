			<p class="project-description">The client’s goal was to enhance the lobby space of the newly built Rihan Heights, luxury residential towers with original artworks. Artist Wasel was commissioned to create 5 original oil paintings for each of the 5 towers.  The aim was to give a unique personality to each tower and elevate the modern elegance of Rihan Heights to a new level.  The Client implicitly requested that each painting be the centerpiece of the lobby while harmoniously assimilating with the architectural structure and ceiling light installation.<br>
			<br>WASELROSA managed the project from its inception; including the project proposal, onsite client meetings, budgeting, artist’s safety while completing the installations and bringing the project to its completion on time to meet the opening schedule of the residential towers. Each work had a finished measurement of 15’7″ x 7’8″ and the project was completed within sixty-six days.</p>

				<p class="project-description">Wasel Choi (previously known as Wasel Safwan) has been studying and exploring the lines that he creates subconsciously for many years. He believes that he has always been influenced by railway tracks and airplane wings. He has come to call the influence of railways and wings in his artwork as the Lines. With this passionate expedition, he has been creating unique artworks and developing these Lines in two different mediums; paintings and 30 second video shorts. You often find robust lines that create dimensions and spaces in an intriguing way. These lines often meet and separate with sweeping shapes and colors into a wave of motion as if these lines and planes are drifting by a gentle breeze. He particularly enjoys working on the largest scale possible for a given work because it allows him a greater space in which to stretch the Lines.<br>
				<br>Trained as an architect, self-taught artist Wasel Choi’s enigmatic universe invites you to take a journey deep into his personal subconscious world and the spiritual dimension of his personality.</p>

			<p class="project-description">Prof. Falkenburg has been and remains a dear friend to us, and a special mentor to designer Rosa.  For his new book, a ten-year labor of love, Prof. Falkenburg needed a cover illustration and he approached Rosa for the design.  When asked if she was interested in creating this cover design, she didn't hesitate to say yes!<br>
			<br>Our mission was to create an illustration that captures the essence of the author’s interpretation of Hieronymus Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. The author wanted an image to depict the Gestalt of the Mouth of Hell. He offers the interpretation that Bosch’s triptych should, or could, be read as a speculum of the infernal course mankind has taken in a world that is perverted by satanic forces. Our challenge was to create an image by using Bosch’s own triptych painting to illustrate the author’s interpretation.</p>

			<p class="project-description">We’ve known Deborah both on a personal and professional level for several years.  Not only is Deborah a fabulous person and a friend that we both met in Abu Dhabi but also she is an incredibly talented storyteller. We immediately fell in love with the manuscript for The Time Locket while considering to work on the cover art for her self-published book. Our goal was to create a scaleable cover illustration/design for both e-book and print-on-demand formats.  The author wanted a contemporary vibe, and graphic image that gives a nice visual punch, thereby capturing the curiosity and imagination of the Young Adult reading audience.</p>

				<p class="project-description">Deborah Quinn learned most of her history from novels, which makes her version of history very exciting but not always accurate. Deborah grew up in the Midwestern United States, then moved to Manhattan, where she spent almost twenty years, and now she lives with her husband, two children, and two skittish cats, in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. It gets so hot there in the summer that you can—literally—fry eggs on the sidewalks. She is currently at work on a second project, about vengeful ghosts, and on a movie about an eccentric woman explorer who discovered a lost city in Syria, early in the nineteenth century.</p>

				<p class="client-feedback">“Working with Rosa on the cover of The Time Locket was a fantastic experience, which isn't usually what people say about working with designers.  She listened carefully to my "vision" of the book jacket and then brought that vision to the page in a wonderful way.  Equally wonderful was her patience in the final stages of the process, when she fielded many, many emails from me that started "what if we tried..."  or "could you possibly do this..."   She never dismissed my suggestions, even when it became clear that her original designs were the right way to go.  I had no problems uploading her files to the various sites I was using for e-publishing and print-on-demand; she turned in beautiful work in a professional and timely manner.  Rosa will be the designer I turn to for all my future projects, and in fact I've already recommended her to several other writers.”</p>

			<p class="project-description">At WASELROSA, our work is driven by the founding philosophy that in daily life, our subconscious aesthetic is omni-present; dictating our decisions about everything around us from the clothes we choose to which artworks we hang in our living room to which latest app we decide to use, our material possessions and the activities in which we engage. Often we are unaware of why we make the choices we make. We believe that remarkable design and artistry, and master craftsmanship serve as more than presentation and are the main drivers for these choices we make. Our subconscious is constantly striving to obtain a newer and better way to receive information and goods. For this reason, we are all part of the ever-turning wheel of creation and innovation.<br>
			<br>We work with individuals and companies of all shapes and sizes. From prints to websites, art production (illustrations and fine-art paintings) to art consultation and project management. We look forward to the opportunity to serve your artistic journey – wherever it may lead.<br>
			<br>We are currently accepting freelance work!
